Nodejs View a Transaction and OP_RETURN message by txid

  This is a basic op_return viewer based on inputting the txid and gathering the results.
  this is still in the early stages and is currently setup for future development.

  Currently, this requires running coind (Coin Daemon) on a server using Node.JS
  with command level ability.
